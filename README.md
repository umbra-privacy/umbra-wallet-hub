## About Umbra

Umbra is a user-friendly, secure browser extension wallet designed specifically for the Aztec Network. With a focus on privacy and seamless user experience, Umbra empowers users to manage their assets and interact with dApps while maintaining full control over their privacy settings.

## Why is the Source Code Private?

During the early stages of the Aztec ecosystem, we maintain Umbra's core implementation as private code to ensure the highest standards of security and user protection. This decision helps prevent untested clones that could put users' assets at risk and allows us to rapidly adapt to protocol changes. As we work towards becoming the definitive platform for Aztec users, this approach enables us to maintain strict quality controls and rapidly incorporate user feedback. We plan to gradually open-source components after thorough security audits and as the ecosystem matures. Meanwhile, this public repository serves as the official hub for releases, documentation, and community support.
